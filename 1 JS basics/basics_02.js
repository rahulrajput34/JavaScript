//Operatos

// var, let, const

// the difference bwtween const and let is ... when we difine a valriable by using let that time it is not  mendatory to give value at the time.
// but when we create variable by using the const keyword that time it is mandatory to assign a value at a time of creation.
// var we are not going to use.

let a = 10;
let b = "10";
console.log(a**b);
console.log(a + b);
console.log(a - b);
console.log(a / b);
console.log(a * b);
console.log(a % b);

// comparison operators

//  == for not strick check (check datatype)
// === for strick check
// we also have, ! , < , > , <= , >=s

if(a === b){
    console.log("We are equal");
}else{
    console.log("we are not equal");
}
